# ParticleFilter

<h3> App download as a .jar file </h3>
To download the app, simply download ParticleFilterJava14.jar or ParticleFilterJava8.jar. The Java 14 jar may be more up to date than the Java 8 jar, though I will try to keep them more or less the same. If the Java 14 jar doesn't work, it may be because you don't have the most up to date version of Java. Simply try the Java 8 jar. <br>
<strong> Your computer will probably warn you you are openning a dangerous file. </strong> .jar files, by their nature, are a way for programmers to quickly package their code into a runnable file. That warning is just telling you there is no regulation over or gaurantee that the code in a jar file is not a virus.  It does not mean that the file actually contains anything dangerous. <br><br>

<h3> Cloning the repo </h3>
Feel free to clone this repository and change the code.  We'll try to keep things commented, but I'm not making any promises on that front...


<h3> Bugs? </h3>
If you have any problems openning the jars, or find any bugs in the app, please let us know! We will try our best to fix them if we can.  If you have any ideas for improvements, also feel free to let us know. We may decide to implement it!
